# Bitwisr: i2CS Curriculum

## Objectives
* Introduce Computer Science topics to middle school students before they have access to Computer Science classes in high school
* Cover introductory/simple languages like HTML/CSS, Python, and JavaScript
* Hosted on GitHub so that anyone can view, access, download, and adapt the curriculum to fit their needs, and to encourage a community of people to provide feedback and even help develop the curriculum further
* Give students with no previous background in Computer Science the resources to learn useful skills and continue their learning beyond the classroom
* Provide environments where students can work closely with instructors/teachers to develop skills
* Give current Computer Science students a chance to volunteer with their community and further their own skills in teaching and Computer Science by allowing them to teach most of the class
* Incorporate interdisciplinary themes into a Computer Science foundation to synthesize knowledge of Physics, Mathematics, Art, Philosophy, Ethics, Literature, Economics, etc
* Work with students to hone their skills in preparation for competitive events and real world applications of their knowledge
* Show how an understanding of Computer Science can be beneficial in terms of employment and job security
* Introduce the concepts of Open Source, FOSS, Linux/UNIX systems, Internet security and safety, Version Control, etc
* Build upon the platforms of Hour of Code and Code Academy to provide a year long, structured environment for students to learn about topics in Computer Science

## Resources
To facilitate the teaching of this program, several resources and materials are required. These include:
* Access to a computer and the Internet
* Access to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkpoeMuRS2uO-_LTbQTSCdw)
* Text Editors like Atom (Preferred), Notepad, Notepad++, Notepad 2, etc
* Computers running Python 3
* A variety of web browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Edge

## Use
This curriculum will be divided into Units and Lessons, with each Unit covering a broad topic of instruction and consisting of several lessons which focus on an aspect of that topic. Lessons will consist of an overview document providing background on the subject, the “in class” assignments, and information for further inquiry, as well as any necessary accompanying files for download.Each Unit and Lesson will be hosted on [GitHub](http://www.github.com), a web front end for the Git version control system. By using GitHub, students will learn about the importance of version control in Computer Science and how to use one of the most common pieces of version control software as well as have easy access to the materials required for each class.

### For Students
It is not necessary for students to have an account with GitHub in order to view and download the lessons. Lessons can be downloaded from any computer with access to the Internet, and no special software or licensing/account/sign up is needed. The materials be accessed anywhere, although some software may need to be installed to complete the tasks. All the software used by this curriculum is either 1) free or, 2) has free alternatives which can be used in its place. Wherever possible, the software that is used will be Free and Open Source (FOSS) to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn.

### For Contributors
For people wishing to contribute to this curriculum, fear not! By using GitHub, anyone who has something to add can submit proposals to make this collection even better! To do so, you will need an account with GitHub. Simply fork this repository, make the changes, and submit your proposal. If we think that you have some good points, we will merge your edits into the main repository and your work will be seen by all.
